Greetings ðŸ‘‹,

I am Enrico, a Software Developer, gym addict, tech enthusiast and space and aviation fan.

This website serves as a platform to share my thoughts, insights, and showcase the various projects I've undertaken â€” those fortunate enough to see the light of day, that is. I am constantly experimenting with new ideas, which results in a noteworthy graveyard of unfinished projects. For a closer look at these endeavours, you can visit my [project page](/projects) or my [personal GitHub account](https://github.com/enrico-kaack) to discover the lucky ones that made it to the finish line.

In my professional life, my primary focus revolves around Go for Kubernetes development and Swift for iOS projects. I contribute to my employer's open-source Kubernetes Operator projects. You can explore those in my [work GitHub profile](https://github.com/enrico-kaack-comp).

## History

Behind most passionate developers lies a unique tale of how their fascination with problem-solving, logical thinking, and programming took root.

This is mine.

### The Beginning

My story began in the summer break after either 7th or 8th grade when I purchased a book titled Delphi For Kids and started to learn Delphi. I distinctly remember seizing the opportunity to apply this newfound knowledge to a school project the following year, which was around 2011.

The assignment was to construct a pendulum clock with a unique twist. When the pendulum rested, it was meant to close a circuit, prompting a small fan to set the pendulum into motion. To measure the clock's swings, the teacher had planned to use a bicycle computer as a counter. However, I found the bicycle computer idea rather mundane.

I decided to dismantle an old computer mouse since a mouse click effectively closes a circuit. Subsequently, I created a simple graphical user interface (GUI) program, featuring a prominent button at the center of the screen. This button would register the clicks and, in turn, measure the accuracy of my group's one-second-per-tick clock. As it turned out, our clock may not have been the best among the teams, but thanks to my solution, we knew down to the millisecond just how far off it was. In my memories, our clock scored worst, my memories must have become a bit fuzzy I guess.

During my later school years, I studied Java since I wanted to write Apps for my Android Phone. I built some smaller Apps with friends I made along the way, although none of them are noteworthy. Fortunately for me, this hobby, driven by interest and curiosity, made it straightforward for me to shape my career path after school.

### The Study

During my final years of high school, I decided to pursue a B.Sc. in Applied Computer Science through a corporative study program. This program alternated between three months of intensive university studies and three-month internships at my employer. Looking back, I think I really picked an excellent program with an excellent company, providing me with a multitude of opportunities for learning, growth, and exploration.

After 3 years and completing my undergrad studies, I received the opportunity from the company to pursue full-time graduate studies while working as a student. This allowed me to delve deeply into a wide array of subjects at university. I engaged in courses spanning high-performance computing, GPU computing, microcontrollers, distributed systems, machine learning and psychology.

### Professional Career

Following the successful completion of my studies, culminating in an M.Sc. in Computer Science, I continued my journey with the same company and had the privilege of becoming part of an exceptional team. We were tasked with the development of an open-source project focused on lifecycle management operations, as well as the creation of a Software as a Service (SaaS) offering based on this service.
