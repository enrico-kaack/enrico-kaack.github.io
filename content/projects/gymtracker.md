A minimalistic iOS App to track gym workouts.

Started as a learning project to get back into Swift and iOS app development, I continued since I was unhappy with existing gym tracking apps. Now I have a stable MVP state, that will be tested with friends soon.

## Design Goals

I aligned my development of the app around building a streamlined app, and doing the core features well. It should leverage the platform's features and usability.

## Features of MVP

- Track a workout in the gym
- Preset the repetitions and weight from the last exercise execution to improve
- Create templates to simplify adding exercises to a current workout
- Show the weight and repetition history of every exercise
- Graph the progress to see improvements in strength over time

## Roadmap

- Provide a companion or standalone Apple Watch application
- Compile the iOS app for Mac and iPad with iCloud sync to show charts and workout history on larger devices
- Include SharePlay to work out together with others locally or remotely
